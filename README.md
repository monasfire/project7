# Polymarket Trading Bot – BTC & ETH Binary Markets

**Rust trading bot for Polymarket prediction markets.** Automates hedging and position management on BTC and ETH binary (Up/Down) markets with 15m and 1h timeframes. Lock profit when cost per pair is favorable; expand positions when the opposite side is rising and PnL is skewed.

## Features

- **Dual timeframe:** Trades **15m** and **1h** binary markets for BTC and ETH on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com).
- **Lock rule:** Buys the opposite side only when **cost per pair** stays under your cap (e.g. Up_avg + Down_ask ≤ 0.99), so you lock in edge.
- **Expansion rule:** When you can’t lock (cost would exceed max) but the other side is **rising** and its outcome PnL is worse, the bot buys that side to improve exposure (see [logic.md](logic.md)).
- **Ride the winner:** When one side is clearly winning (trend UpRising/DownRising), the bot adds to that side to grow “PnL if that side wins.”
- **PnL rebalance:** If one outcome’s PnL is negative and you’re not strongly trending the other way, it buys the weak side (within cost limits).
- **Flat = no trade:** When the short-term trend is **Flat** (no clear move), the bot only locks if conditions allow; otherwise it does not open new risk (Example 6 in [logic.md](logic.md)).
- **1h throttle:** Configurable cooldown for 1h markets (e.g. 30–45s between buys) to avoid overtrading.
- **Simulation mode:** Run with `--simulation` (default) to log trades without sending orders.
- **Market resolution:** Checks for closed markets, computes actual PnL, and logs “Total actual PnL (all time).”
- **Timestamped logs:** Price feed and history lines include `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS]` for easier debugging and backtesting.

## Strategy Overview

The bot keeps **positions** per market (Up shares, Down shares, average prices). Each tick it:

1. Updates **trend** from the last 4–5 price points (UpRising, DownRising, Flat, UpFalling, DownFalling).
2. **Lock:** If adding the underweight side keeps cost per pair ≤ `cost_per_pair_max` → buy that side (lock).
3. **Expansion:** If you *can’t* lock (cost would exceed max) but the other side is **rising** and “PnL if that side wins” is worse → buy that side (new leg / rebalance).
4. **Ride winner:** If trend is UpRising or DownRising (and not Flat) → buy the rising side (within cost and buy limits).
5. **PnL rebalance:** If one outcome’s PnL is negative and trend isn’t strongly the other way → buy the weak side (within limits).
6. **Trend fallback:** DownFalling → can buy Up; UpFalling → can buy Down (no buy on Flat except lock).

Detailed examples (no position, only Up, only Down, have both, Flat, market close) are in **[logic.md](logic.md)**.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cakaroni/polymarket-trading-bot-btc-15m.git
cd polymarket-trading-bot
cargo build --release
```

## Configuration

Copy the example config and edit with your settings:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your Polymarket API keys and trading parameters
```

**Important:** `config.json` is gitignored. Do not commit real API keys.

### Trading options (in `config.json` → `trading`)

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `markets` | Assets to trade | `["btc", "eth"]` |
| `timeframes` | Periods | `["15m", "1h"]` |
| `cost_per_pair_max` | Max cost per pair when locking | `0.99` |
| `min_side_price` | Don’t buy below this ask | `0.05` |
| `max_side_price` | Don’t buy above this ask | `0.99` |
| `cooldown_seconds` | Min seconds between buys (15m) | `0` |
| `cooldown_seconds_1h` | Min seconds between buys (1h) | `30` or `45` |
| `shares` | Override size per order; `null` = per-market default | `null` |
| `size_reduce_after_secs` | Start reducing size in last N seconds | `300` |
| `market_closure_check_interval_seconds` | How often to check for resolved markets | `20` |

## Usage

**Simulation (no real orders):**

```bash
cargo run -- --simulation
# or
cargo run --release -- --simulation
```

**Live trading (sends FAK orders to Polymarket):**

```bash
cargo run --release -- --production --config config.json
```

**Redeem winnings for a resolved market:**

```bash
cargo run --release -- --redeem --condition-id <CONDITION_ID>
```

Logs go to `history.toml` (and your configured log target). Price lines look like:

```text
[2026-02-04T23:17:23] BTC 15m Up Token BID:$0.52 ASK:$0.53 Down Token BID:$0.47 ASK:$0.48 remaining time:12m 34s
```
